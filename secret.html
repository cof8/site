        <p>Good work everyone. The plan is going perfectly.</p>

        <br>

        <p>Right now he has his account "back" and he is feeling confident again.</p>
        <p>As we all know by now, we must regulate his condifdence level or else he will not comply.</p>
        <p>Too much or too little is bad for business. This is why there's a never ending cycle of </p>
        <p>breaking him down only to let him build back up again. Luckily, he enjoys the repetition.</p>
        
        <br>

        <p>Operation LCP has been a huge success. Soon he will be on the "Lolcow Podcast" just as we've</p>
        <p>planned and directed him. Him being on there expedites our mission greatly.</p>
        <p>Keem, Boogie, and Wings have all been paid for their participation. We thank them.</p>

        <br>

        <p><strong>WE MUST ENSURE HE MAKES AN APPERANCE ON THE LOLCOW PODCAST AT ALL COSTS!</strong></p>

        <br>

        <p>So please, in public, act "upset" or "angry" that he will be on there.</p>
        <p>It will only make him want to appear even more!</p>

        <br>

        <p>That's it for now. Great things are about to happen!</p>
